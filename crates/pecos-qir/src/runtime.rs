/// QIR Runtime Implementation
///
/// This file contains the implementation of the QIR runtime functions that are used
/// when executing QIR programs. It defines the C-compatible functions that are called
/// by the QIR program to perform quantum operations.
///
/// # QIR Runtime Library
///
/// This file is a key component of the QIR runtime library, which is built by the
/// `build.rs` script in the pecos-qir crate. The library is pre-built and placed
/// in the target directory to speed up QIR compilation.
///
/// When the QIR compiler runs, it first checks for a pre-built library. If found,
/// it uses that library directly. If not, it falls back to building the runtime
/// on-demand using this file and related files.
///
/// # Implementation Details
///
/// The runtime provides functions for:
/// - Quantum gate operations (H, X, Y, Z, etc.)
/// - Qubit and result allocation/release
/// - Measurement operations
/// - Classical control operations
/// - Logging and message output
///
/// # Safety
///
/// All quantum gate functions are called from C/C++ code and assume that qubit IDs
/// are valid and have been properly allocated. Calling with invalid qubit IDs may
/// lead to undefined behavior.
///
